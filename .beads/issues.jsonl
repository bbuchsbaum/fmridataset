Python currently reshapes 1D arrays to 1xN rows using np.atleast_2d, causing run_length mismatches and incorrect orientation. Fix by reshaping 1D inputs to (-1,1) and adding regression coverage.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"brad.buchsbaum@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-17T07:19:43.246244-05:00","created_by":"bbuchsbaum","updated_at":"2026-02-17T07:19:43.246244-05:00","labels":["matrix_dataset","parity","python"]}
{"id":"fmridataset-noh","title":"Clarify fmri_dataset deprecated backend argument contract","description":"When fmri_dataset was called with scans as file paths and deprecated `backend` argument set to a non-storage object (e.g. \"nifti\"), function continued into backend_open and emitted generic Invalid backend object error. This is now a clearer stop: backend must be storage_backend object when supplied. Added regression test in test_additional_cases.R and validated with devtools::load_all + testthat::test_file.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"brad.buchsbaum@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-17T07:21:38.828837-05:00","created_by":"bbuchsbaum","updated_at":"2026-02-17T07:21:38.828837-05:00"}
