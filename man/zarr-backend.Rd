\title{Zarr Storage Backend}
\description{
A storage backend implementation for Zarr array format using the CRAN zarr package.
Zarr is a cloud-native array storage format that supports chunked, compressed
n-dimensional arrays with concurrent read/write access.
}
\details{
This backend provides efficient access to neuroimaging data stored in Zarr format,
which is particularly well-suited for:
\itemize{
\item Large datasets that don't fit in memory
\item Cloud storage (S3, GCS, Azure)
\item Parallel processing workflows
\item Progressive data access patterns
}

The backend expects Zarr arrays organized as a 4D array with dimensions (x, y, z, time).
The CRAN zarr package uses R6 classes and supports Zarr v3 format only.
}
\section{Experimental}{

This backend uses the CRAN zarr package which is relatively new (v0.1.1, Dec 2025).
It supports Zarr v3 format only - Zarr v2 stores cannot be read.
Please report any issues to help improve the package.
