\title{Zarr Storage Backend}
\description{
A storage backend implementation for Zarr array format using the Rarr package.
Zarr is a cloud-native array storage format that supports chunked, compressed
n-dimensional arrays with concurrent read/write access.
}
\details{
This backend provides efficient access to neuroimaging data stored in Zarr format,
which is particularly well-suited for:
\itemize{
\item Large datasets that don't fit in memory
\item Cloud storage (S3, GCS, Azure)
\item Parallel processing workflows
\item Progressive data access patterns
}

The backend expects Zarr arrays organized as:
\itemize{
\item 4D array with dimensions (x, y, z, time)
\item Optional mask array at "mask" key
\item Metadata stored as Zarr attributes
}
}
