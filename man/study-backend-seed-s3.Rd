\title{Study Backend Seed for DelayedArray (S3 Implementation)}
\description{
A DelayedArray-compatible seed that provides lazy access to multi-subject fMRI data
without loading all subjects into memory at once. This is a pure S3 implementation
that maintains compatibility with DelayedArray through S3 methods.
}
\details{
This class implements the DelayedArray seed contract using S3 methods, providing:
\itemize{
\item Lazy loading of subject data
\item LRU caching with configurable memory limits
\item Efficient subset extraction
\item Compatibility with DelayedArray operations
}
}
