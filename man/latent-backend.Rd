\title{Latent Storage Backend}
\description{
A storage backend implementation for latent space representations of fMRI data.
This backend works with data that has been decomposed into temporal components
(basis functions) and spatial loadings.
}
\details{
Unlike traditional voxel-based backends, latent backends store:
\itemize{
\item Temporal basis functions (time × components)
\item Spatial loadings (voxels × components)
\item Optional per-voxel offsets
}

The backend maintains compatibility with the storage_backend contract while
providing specialized methods for latent data access.
