# Series Selector Classes for fMRI Data

A family of S3 classes for specifying spatial selections in fMRI
datasets. These selectors provide a type-safe, explicit interface for
selecting voxels in
[`fmri_series()`](https://bbuchsbaum.github.io/fmridataset/reference/fmri_series.md)
and related functions.
